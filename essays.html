<a href = "#p4">Do We Have a Fine Tuner?</a><br>
<p>Roger White describes a way to move from the seemingly bland observation that the universe is the sort of place whose physical laws allow it to contain living creatures like ourselves, to justified belief in the existence of God. Reconstruct his argument and describe what you take to be the best objection(s) to it. Does any of them defeat the argument?</p>
<a href = "#p5">Projectibility of Properties</a><br>
<p>According to Goodman, some properties (like being green) figure in good inductive reasoning, and other properties (like being grue) do not. In our terms: some properties are projectable and other properties are non-projectable. Explain precisely what he means by this (you will want to explain what he means by ‘inductive reasoning’, and give some examples of projectable and non-projectable properties.) In general, what makes some properties projectable and others not?</p>
<a href = "#p6">Freedom of Choices and Moral Responsibility</a><br>
<p>Harry Frankfurt says that it is possible for a person to be morally responsible for doing something, though he or she could not have done anything else. Is he right? (You will want to consider, in detail, the cases he describes). If not, why not? If so, does this show that there can be moral responsibility in a world governed by deterministic laws?</p>

    <h1>When Milton Considers How His Light Is Spent</h1>
    
    <p>“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light” (Genesis 1:3). Ever since the creation of this matter, humans have woken up to natural light, invented artificial light, and sought spiritual light. Literally and figuratively, light guides our way. In his epic <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Milton asks his Muse to “illumine” (1.22) him so that light can direct his arguments. This light not only helps him “justify the ways of God” (1.126), but also allows him to embark on a more personal journey, in which he reflects on his own being through his relationship with light. Despite his many references to light, Milton never clearly defines this natural agent. Thus, we may only infer what light means to him by analyzing his verses and considering his background. Together, the text of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Milton’s blindness, and his religious belief suggest that Miltonic light embodies spiritual goodness, a vision beyond mortal sight, and salvation by inner grace.</p>
    <p>Before answering the question of what light is, the poem tries to clarify where light comes from. Describing light as the “offspring of Heav’n firstborn” (3.1), the invocation in Book 3 begins by stating that light is God’s first creation. Uncertain of this explanation, the narrator offers another possibility that light is the “Eternal coeternal beam” (3.2), a substance independent of God. Then, he equates God with light, implying that light is neither a creation of nor a coexistence with God; rather, light and God are interchangeable. This assumption is again replaced by the claim that God dwells in light, which suggests that light precedes God, who appears as the “Bright effluence of bright essence increate” (3.6).</p>
    <p>The ambiguity in the origin of light further mystifies this intangible matter, rendering its meaning more fascinating to readers. Whether God has created light or light has created God or they have come into being together, the strong association between God and light indicates that Miltonic light denotes spiritual goodness. Indeed, the narrator often employs brightness as a physical representation of a character’s virtue. The perfectly noble God, therefore, is surrounded by such “glorious brightness” (3.376) that He becomes “invisible” (3.375). The angels of Heaven, “[standing] thick as stars” (3.61), are also very bright beings. Although Satan used to be Lucifer the Light-bringer “clothed with transcendent brightness” (1.86), he gradually loses his “original brightness” (1.591), retaining only a hint of “false glitter” (10.452). </p>
    <p>However, brightness alone is not sufficient to separate good from evil. Similar to light, fire is also bright. Yet, while light epitomizes God and Heaven, fire is associated with devils and Hell. The key difference between light and fire lies in their tangibility. Making humans “set and rise” (4.664) with light, God, like a “bright officious [lamp]” (9.105), exerts an intangible and spiritual control on humans. Following God by faith, His worshippers do not need to see Him or obtain proofs of His authority to believe in Him. When the devils attempt to “imitate” this kind of “[God’s] light” (2.269-270), they only manage to recreate its brightness through “tempestuous fire” (1.77), but they cannot capture light’s divinity because fire is tangible and corporeal. Not surprisingly, this flaming substance, with its connotation of bodily pain, characterizes Hell. That Satan has to make himself visible to Eve in the form of a serpent and that he has to present lengthy arguments to trick her into eating the apple illustrate that Satan’s manipulation of humans differs from God’s spiritual control. Had Eve not seen the serpent and its physical proof of power, which is the apple from the Tree of Knowledge, Satan would not have been able to tempt her. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the devil’s “contagious fire” (9.1036) has succeeded in infecting our first two parents. After Adam and Eve eat the apple, both of them experience immeasurable “delight” (9.787 and 9.1023). With the prefix “de-“ expressing “removal,” the word “delight” conveys a sense of losing light, hinting at the Fall of Man. The etymology of this word supports such interpretation. Coming from Latin <i>delectare</i> “to allure,” the word “delight” suggests temptation and is thus closely related to Satan the Tempter. Because Satan is God’s greatest foe, the delight offered by him becomes the opposite of the light given by God. Aiming to corrupt humans, Satan’s actions to “delight” Adam and Eve essentially strip them of their spiritual goodness.</p>
    <p>To regain his virtuousness, the narrator invokes his Muse, asking the Holy Spirit to “Illumine” “what in [him] is dark” (1.22-23). This darkness not only refers to the baseness of human nature, but also alludes to Milton’s blindness, making light more personal to Milton. By asking the Muse to illuminate him, Milton reveals that he wants a vision. Rather than a recovery from his blindness, his desired vision is the ability to “see and tell / Of things invisible to mortal sight” (3.54-55). This special vision allows him to perceive the disguise of the fallen angels while others, like the peasant charmed by the dancing elves, fail to realize the danger of being enticed by evils. He hopes that his vision beyond mortal sight will equate him with “Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, / And Tiresias and Phineus” (3.35-36), bringing him as much “renown” (3.34) as these poets and prophets have attained. Transitioning from an account of his own aspiration, Milton continues to use sight-related words to describe God, highlighting how God “[bends] down his eye,” “[views]” “His own works,” “[receives] / Beatitude” “from his sight,” and [beholds] / (humans’) two first parents” (3.58-65). The implicit comparison between Milton’s vision and God’s vision further suggests that the light from heavenly Muse gives Milton a divine and perceptive sight, superior to that of the worldly and undiscriminating mortals.</p>
    <p>When invoking his Muse, Milton claims that the “celestial Light / [shines] inward, and the mind through all her powers / Irradiate” (3.51-53). Such notion that God’s light shines into humans’ souls reminds readers of the Christian belief that salvation is achieved through inner grace, adding another layer of meaning to Miltonic light. Although God “[sits] / Throned inaccessible” (3.376-377), man still have access to His light. God has not abandoned humans because He allows them to “[escape]” their damnation in “the Stygian pool” (3.14) and “revisit” (3.13) their salvation in light. Responding to the Son’s fear that Satan will corrupt men completely, the Father reaffirms that “[men] shall not quite be lost, but saved” (3.173) “for [He] will clear their senses dark” (3.188). According to the Father, men will be able to achieve both spiritual goodness and ultimate salvation by acquiring light. The process of “[reascending]” (3.20) from darkness is “hard and rare” (3.21), but the Father’s speech gives men hope because He promises to “place within them a guide / [His] umpire conscience, whom if they will hear, / Light after light well used they shall attain” (3.194-196). Therefore, if humans follow the guidance of their inner light in the right way, they will receive more and more light until they “arrive [at Heaven]” (3.197); on the other hand, those who choose not to follow the light of conscience “shall never taste” (3.199) salvation, “But hard be hardened, blind be blinded more” (3.200). </p>
    <p>The choice between following the light and neglecting it evokes the central theme that men are both free to be saved and free to fall, corresponding to the statement that “The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n” (1.254-255). In his final words to Adam before Adam and Eve’s departure from Eden, Michael emphasizes the importance of making the right choice by instructing Adam to “add faith, …virtue, patience, temperance, …(and) love” (12.583-583) to his knowledge so that he can “possess / A paradise within [him]” (12.586-587). Michael’s assertion that Adam will be happier by possessing an inner paradise than by physically living in Eden further illustrates that the attainment of light or salvation is not so much related to men’s surroundings as to their consciences. With inner grace, men can be saved wherever they are.</p>
    <p>This connection between light and salvation by grace echoes Milton’s conclusion of his sonnet “When I Consider How My Light Is Spent.” Worried that blindness will prevent him from serving God, he finally realizes that “God doth not need / Either man’s work or his own gifts” (9-10); in fact, standing by and waiting on God is enough for His satisfaction. In this way, the sonnet confirms that humans can be accepted and saved by God no matter what their physical conditions are. Because “celestial Light” (3.51) can “irradiate” (3.55) the sighted and the sightless alike, God installs grace in whoever chooses to follow His light. Although Milton starts by considering how his physical light is extinguished, he seems to conclude that his real light is not extinguished after all. Since his blindness does not preclude him from achieving spiritual goodness, a vision beyond mortal sight, or salvation by inner grace, he is free to approach light even when light does not come to him. Just like Milton, nothing hinders us from pursuing light in times of difficulty. When facing exterior darkness, we can retain our inner light to keep us from corruption. By becoming our own source of illumination, we will never have our light spent. </p>

    <h1>Are We Saved?</h1>
    
    <p>“And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works” (Revelation 20:12, King James Bible). By setting sin and salvation as two fixed opposites, the Christian faith claims that on the Judgment Day, the sinners are “cast into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15, King James Bible) while those who are saved will enjoy immortality and unending happiness. Drawing on the themes of sin and redemption, Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> hones in these prominent Christian beliefs and provides an elaborate yet dissimilar view from that of the Bible and consequently from that of the Puritan society which upheld these Christian values. The highly symbolic character of Pearl epitomizes Hawthorne’s complex attitude toward sin and redemption. As a reminder of sin, a prompt for salvation, and an emblem for resurrection, Pearl parallels both Christ and redemption itself. Different from the Bible, however, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> does not present salvation and depravity as two separate and irreversible states; instead, it suggests that the boundary between the two can be ambiguous and that sinners have opportunities to actively redeem themselves before the Last Judgment.</p>
    <p>Although the narrator often depicts Pearl as the “elf-child” (74) or the “demon offspring” (68), Pearl does not represent evils. Born from sin, Pearl nevertheless embodies an “innocent life” and an “immortal flower” made by “the inscrutable decree of Providence” (61). By emphasizing Pearl’s innocence, immortality, and her relationship to God, the novel hints at the similarities between Christ and Pearl, both coming to earth under God’s command. The opposition between Pearl and the Black Man, the force of depravity, further suggests that Pearl sides with the force of morality. In her role as a protector, Pearl has saved her mother several times from “Satan’s snare” (80) by preventing Hester from engaging in witchcraft. Believing that the Black Man cannot catch her, Pearl is rendered beyond the control of evilness. Indeed, despite the prevalence of physical darkness in the novel, the presence of Pearl usually couples with the appearance of light and sunshine, which are also associated with Christ and redemption. In this way, the novel primarily establishes Pearl as a positive influence.</p>
    <p>Following this interpretation, we may find Pearl’s naughtiness puzzling. Though Pearl does not have Christ’s all-loving character and patience, she uses her mischievous behavior as a reminder of Hester and Dimmesdale’s sin. As “her mother’s only treasure” “purchased with all [Hester] had” (61), Pearl echoes the pearl from a biblical parable, in which “the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it” (Matthew 13:45-46, King James Bible). While the popular reading equates the merchant man with the sinner and the pearl with Christ, a lesser common reading parallels the merchant man with Christ and the pearl with salvation for all mankind. The role of Pearl in <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> matches both interpretations of the pearl in the parable. As a Christ-like figure, Pearl constantly reminds Hester and Dimmesdale of their wrongdoings and prompts them to redeem. Often carrying a “mocking smile” (63), Pearl evokes a poignant sense of guilt within the hearts of sinners. Tortured by this smile, Hester wonders whether Pearl is her punishment, crying, “Child, what art thou” (67). Rather than responding with “I am your daughter,” Pearl answers, “I am your little Pearl” (67). This response implies that although Pearl is torturing her mother at the moment, her can ultimately save Hester and fulfills the function as “the pearl of great price.” When Hester further questions about “who sent [her child] hither” (67), Pearl insists that Hester answer this question herself. Just like Christ seeks to make humans realize their own sins, Pearl encourages Hester to face her own immoralities and then redeem them. Pearl also laughs at Dimmesdale when he refuses to stand with her and Hester on the scaffold in the daylight and she laughs again when he promises to stand with them “at the great judgment day” (105). Her laughs not only point to the hypocrisy and cowardice of the minister, but also suggest her disbelief in the Judgment Day. Not understanding what the Judgment Day is, Pearl wants Dimmesdale to stand with her sooner in his lifetime rather than later. Through Pearl, the novel hints at the possibility of self-redemption before the Last Judgment, which makes the recognition of one’s sin even more urgent. The repetition of Pearl’s questions “What does the letter mean, mother?&mdash;and why dost thou wear it?&mdash;and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?” (124) reinforces Pearl’s function both as a reminder of sin and as a prompt for salvation. Her constant queries and her mocking smile pressure Hester and Dimmesdale to fully understand the gravity of their sin and seek atonement.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, Hester and Dimmesdale cannot perceive Pearl as a real child before their redemption. On a more metaphorical level, salvation is intangible for sinners who have not grasped the severity of their immoralities. After Hester rids herself of the scarlet letter and her hat, she has fallen back to sin and is thus “estranged” (142) from salvation, represented by Pearl. By staring at Hester and Dimmesdale and “pointing [her] small forefingers at Hester’s bosom” (144), Pearl demands her parents not to forget their sin. Only when Hester refastens the scarlet letter and gathers “the heavy tresses of her hair” (145) does the child reaffirm that she is her mother’s little Pearl; in other words, Hester regains her hope to be saved. However, since Dimmesdale still refuses to publicly recognize Pearl as his daughter, he receives “no favor” (146) from her. In fact, Pearl needs to “[bathe] her forehead (in the sunshine)…[to wash] off” (146) the minister’s sinful kiss. Accordingly, Dimmesdale will not be welcomed by salvation until he exposes his sin and repents with his life.</p>
    <p>The torment Pearl inflicts on Hester and Dimmesdale reveals that redemption is not an easy process: sinners have to sacrifice certain things that are dear to them in order to achieve the even dearer salvation. Dimmesdale chooses to give up his reputation and die a death of “triumphant ignominy” (176). This seemingly paradoxical phrase illuminates that he has “won the victory” (175) in his internal moral combat by publicly shaming himself. When “Pearl [kisses] his lips” (175), Dimmesdale attains his “pearl of great price.” With the death of the recipient of Hester’s passion and feminineness, Hester subsequently forgoes these two qualities for her redemption. Therefore, “Pearl’s errand as a messenger (towards her mother) [is] fulfilled” as well (175). As Dimmesdale and Hester are saved from their sin, Pearl becomes a “human” (175) child, tangible to her parents. Since the book does not specify whose “spell [is] broken” (175), we may infer that the spell used to bind not just Pearl, but also Hester and Dimmesdale. In this way, the broken spell refers both to the growing sympathies in Pearl and God’s gift of salvation to her parents.</p>
    <p>As Pearl develops her understanding of “human joy and sorrow” (175), she also becomes a symbol of resurrection for both Dimmesdale and Hester. The reputation forsaken by Dimmesdale and the womanhood forsaken by Hester are reborn in Pearl: she does not repeat the sin committed by her parents and enjoys the “flush and bloom” (179) of feminineness. Even “the gossips of that day” (179) believe that Pearl lead a “happy” (179) life that her parents cannot have. Through Pearl, the novel affirms that sinners can actively redeem themselves instead of passively waiting for God’s judgment. Born out of sin yet eventually transforming into the fruit of salvation, the character of Pearl indicates that the conversion from sin to salvation is possible. That Hester becomes other people’s counselor further suggests that such conversion stimulates personal growth. With her journey from sin to redemption, Hester gains personal strength, learns sympathy, and increases her general understanding of human conditions. Just as Adam and Eve receive knowledge from their fall, Hester acquires “a new truth” (180) about “the whole relation between man and woman” (180) from her depravity. </p>
    <p>Thus, sin can almost be seen as a necessity for redemption because individuals and society cannot improve unless they have faults in the first place. By reconciling sin with personal and societal growth, the novel blurs the line between morality and immorality. Such ambiguity is evident in the arrangement of Hester’s and Dimmesdale’s graves and the inscription on their shared tombstone: has the society upheld its moral standards by separating their graves? Or has it accepted their love to some degree by burying them under one tombstone? Has the “sable”  (180) field stifled the passion of the “scarlet” (180) letter? Or has the scarlet letter stained the purity of the sable field? With the final image of the scarlet A in mind, we may still be unsure about how we view Hester’s life. We know she is the adulteress, yet we can empathize with her because we have our own “hidden sin” (59) and experience similar struggles as Hester does. While we ponder over her story, perhaps a more important question that we need to think about is where we stand between depravity and salvation: can we redeem ourselves before the Judgment Day?</p>

    <h1>Scarecrows in Disguise</h1>
    
    <p>I’m always terrified when people tell me to just be myself. I know I can be labeled as a student, a daughter, and a friend, but I don’t know who I am. Although I was uneasy about this identity crisis at first, I gradually realized that when people say, “Be yourself,” they really mean, “Be a girl with style.” Surely, when colleges tell us to let our personalities shine through, we are supposed to talk about how hardworking we are as students, how attentive we are as family members, and how generous we are as friends. In other words, we are supposed to put on a good show, though the show may be based on reality. After all, colleges only have time to look at our “rat’s coats, crowskin, and crossed staves” (Eliot, “The Hollow Men”). They judge applicants by their styles, not substances. This focus on what’s outside instead of what’s inside doesn’t grow out of thin air. From the London upper class in Oscar Wilde’s <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> to the Congo natives in Joseph Conrad’s <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, people admire the hollow men, as long as they have their styles.</p>
    <p>In Wilde’s Victorian world, Cecily and Gwendolen both fall in love with a man named Earnest. Earnest can’t have any substance; in fact, Earnest isn’t even real. As a made-up character, he is appealing because he has a divine name that apparently inspires “absolute confidence” (Wilde, Act I, p. 2230 and Act II, p. 2247). The two girls like the name so much that they pity any woman who doesn’t marry a man called Earnest. After finding out that they’ve been deceived by two gentlemen whose actual names are Jack and Algernon, they take no time to forgive their lovers, pointing out that the Christian names are the only “insuperable barrier” (Wilde, Act III, p. 2255). Cecily and Gwendolen’s comment seems silly, but in truth, Jack and Algernon are no different from Earnest other than their names. One with an invented brother and the other with a fictitious friend, both men lead more or less made-up lives that contain little substance but much style. They are hollow men, just like Earnest. The strategy they use to cover up their hollowness is called “bunbury,” which is hypocrisy at heart, yet full of elegance and even benevolence when performed in the name of love. The two gentlemen’s ready bunburying and the two ladies’ ready acceptance and encouragement of such act completely reduce earnest from a quality of character to a petty name. With its witty and lighthearted tone, <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> is really about the importance of not being earnest. The ending affirms that while sincerity and seriousness get one nowhere in life, triviality leads to marriage and happiness.</p>
    <p>Similar to Jack and Algernon, Kurtz is a hollow man with flair. Going into Congo with a philanthropic goal, Kurtz sets out to be the man that the society expects him to be, yet he eventually degenerates into an empty core in the wilderness. The wilderness isn’t what causes him to be hollow; rather, it makes his hollowness visible: under the light of civilization, a shadow can attach to social values and morals and take their shapes, but in the uncultivated darkness, a shadow has nothing to depend on, so he loses all his restraints and sense of morality. However, Kurtz’s hollowness doesn’t prevent him from being a remarkable man. His eloquence and grandiosity give the shadow such a style that almost elevates him to godhood. As readers, we know that Kurtz’s great style cannot justify his cruelty, but it’s enough to give him power because the natives, the Intended, the cousin, and even Marlow all choose to focus on what’s outside instead of what’s inside. By being nothing, Kurtz becomes everything—to the natives, he appears as deity; to his Intended, he appears as a humanitarian; to his cousin, he appears as a musician and journalist; to Marlow, he appears as a universal genius. In his dying moment, the hollow man looks inside and sees nothing. “The horror! The horror!” (Conrad, p. 2379) he cries at the “impalpable greyness” (Conrad, p. 2380). Kurtz finally realizes the evils he has done and the evilness he has been, but as the only man to step over the edge, he is the only one that comprehends the horror of hollowness. The other people can do nothing but remain loyal to the shadow he leaves behind. Kurtz’s style lives on and so does his hollowness—the former in people’s memories and the latter in people’s actual beings. In the immense darkness, the time when the general society can look past the superficiality is still far.</p>
    <p>I like to think <i>Heart of Darkness</i> as a novella about self-exploration and I applaud Kurtz’s courage to look inside and judge his own hollowness. Yet like Marlow, I struggle to step over the edge myself. Perhaps our society’s preoccupation with the exterior results exactly from this same fear to pierce into the interior and to confront hollowness. An ostrich facing danger, I bury my head into the sand and attempt to assure myself that with style, a hollow man can be happy and successful. But is it so? Am I content to bunbury through my life? Do I want to become Mr. Kurtz? While I know the answer is no, I also know that the moment I start to search for my substance, I’ll confirm that I’m formless, colorless, and thoughtless. I’ll be defeated. So for now, I cringe into my shadow, projecting the surrounding social labels onto myself. If I can’t beat the hollow men, I’ll join them—with a deliberate disguise.</p>

    <h1>Do We Have a Fine Tuner?</h1>
    <p>“God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform” (William Cowper, <i>Twenty-six Letters on Religious Subjects</i>)&mdash;theists often invoke divine power to justify occurrences that cannot be explained by our current understanding. Applying this connection to the fine-tuning of the cosmological constants, Roger White claims that because an act of God best explains why these constants permit life, theism is well supported. As we assess each premise from White’s argument separately, we’ll find that although his argument is valid, it is not sound. In particular, White has wrongly asserted that the life-permitting constants stand in need of explanation and that theism provides the best explanation for the fine-tuning of our universe. Because the premises are false, we must reject his argument.
</p>
    <p>Consider the fine-tuning argument (FTA):<br>
P1 Inference to the Best Explanation: among all satisfactory explanations, if a hypothesis best explains a fact that stands in need of explanation, this fact provides strong evidential support for the hypothesis.<br>
P2 That the constants are fine-tuned for life calls for explanation.
P3 Among all satisfactory explanations, that God adjusted the constants to be life-permitting best explains the fact described in P2. (Note: I combined P3 and P4 in White’s original paper.)<br>
C The fine-tuning of the constants provides strong evidential support for theism (Roger White, <i>The Argument from Cosmological Fine-Tuning</i>).
</p>
<p>We can see that it’s impossible that all premises be true and conclusion false, so the argument is valid. To check its soundness, we examine if all premises are true. Because P1 is simply a general principle of evidential support and an idea that makes common sense, we take it to be true and focus on P2 and P3.</p>
<p>P2 points to the distinction between facts that need explanation and facts that don’t, an essential basis for White’s argument. If we can prove that the fine-tuning of the constants doesn’t stand in need of explanation, then P1 cannot be used and the conclusion cannot be established by the FTA. White contends that our current universe with life stands out among other possibilities because it is <i>valuable</i>. However, to deem our universe special is a rather egocentric and arbitrary thought. We can illustrate how this notion raises problems by imagining place A where the traffic lights are set up in a way that red means go and green means stop. People from place A would be extremely puzzled when they see us crossing the street with a green light, whereas we would be equally confused to find them crossing the street with a red light. We may conclude that red and green lights have different meanings in the two places, but we cannot say that it’s more correct to assign the meaning of “pass” to green lights. Similarly, we don’t have the right to claim that our state of being is more valuable than the alternative possibilities.</p>
<p>Whether something holds exceptional meaning or value, therefore, depends on <i>perspective</i>. One may challenge my reasoning by saying that even though an event is viewed differently from different perspectives, it can still be valuable, at least to one perspective. This objection breaks down in any <i>subjective</i> case where we are actively assigning meaning to the phenomenon we observed, such as what color of the traffic lights signifies “pass” and what features make a universe valuable. Surely, we can claim that our universe is valuable to us, yet an observer in another possible universe can say the same about that universe. Since all possible combinations of constants are “valuable” from some perspective, this set of life-permitting constants isn’t special and doesn’t call for explanation.</p>
<p>Failing to differentiate between subjective and objective circumstances, White constructs the scrabble letter example, an <i>objective</i> case that isn’t actually analogous to the formation of the constants. His example describes a situation in which we find scrabble letters spelling out a line from <i>Hamlet</i> and another situation in which they spell out a sequence of gibberish. I agree that the former combination of letters needs explanation. In this case, we are not assigning value to the arrangement of the letters; instead, the arrangement has a pre-assigned meaning no matter the viewer understands English or not. Thus, the existence of the line from <i>Hamlet</i> doesn’t depend on the perspective of the viewer. </p>
<p>To clarify the difference between subjective and objective cases, let’s consider a poker game in which your opponent gets twenty strong deals in a row. Even if none of the bystanders know the rules of poker, this sequence of deals still calls for explanation because the value of each deal is pre-assigned and doesn’t depend on the opinion of the viewer. However, a sequence of objects wouldn’t stand in need of explanation simply because it’s aesthetically appealing, which is one reason that White gives for why our universe with life stands out. Imagine strolling down the esplanade with your friends and appreciating the beautiful New England foliage. You may find a particular pattern of leaf colors more charming than others and your friends may have different opinions. There is no right or wrong and there is no need to explain why any of the color patterns exists just because it’s attractive. The aesthetic values of entities are subjective and thus relative, so we cannot single out an entity based on this criterion. Parallel to the foliage pattern example, our life-permitting universe doesn’t call for explanation despite being dear to our heart.</p>
<p>I’ve argued that our universe is no more special than other possibilities. Since White supports P2 with the claims that our universe is valuable and that valuable facts stand in need of explanation, I’ve therefore proved that P2 is false.</p>
<p>In fact, if we are more stringent about the wording of P2, it can be proved false in a simpler way. P2 declares that the cosmological constants are fine-tuned for life. This statement is wrong because these constants permit life only when their sub-parameters are scaled to the values on Earth, considering that we haven’t discovered any extraterrestrial intelligence. For instance, although the universal gravitational constant G is fixed, the gravity g depends on the distance between the planet and the star. As of now, life is solely found in a place where g is 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Whether the fine sub-tuning of the constants on Earth needs explanation is for another discussion, but it’s safe to say that with our current understanding, the cosmological constants themselves are not hospitable to life in general.</p>
<p>I’ve reasoned that P2 is false; nonetheless, White’s argument can also be refuted on the ground of P3. One approach to repudiate P3 is to find explanations that carry equal or more weight than theism for the fine-tuning facts. White identifies the multiverse theory as a candidate, but later clarifies that “the existence of a multiverse does not <i>explain</i> but rather <i>removes the need to explain</i> the fine-tuning of our universe.” Although the FTA is weakened either way, I want to show that the multiverse theory does provide a satisfying alternative explanation, so as to demonstrate that while P2 isn’t true, neither is P3. </p>
<p>To judge whether the multiverse theory overthrows P3, we need to distinguish between an explanation and something that removes the need for explanation. Philosophers have long been divided on the nature of explanation; specifically, they disagree on whether and how explanation is associated with causation (G. Randolph Mayes, “Theories of Explanation”).  For the purpose of our discussion, I’m going to describe explanation as a more general way of deductive reasoning: provided that the given conditions are true and that we can deduce A exclusively from these conditions, we’ll say that these conditions <i>explain</i> A. Admittedly, there are flaws in this description, yet I ask you to refrain from worrying about the inadequacy of my working definition, for it will serve the purpose of evaluating the multiverse theory. </p>
<p>In White’s interpretation, he likens the existence of a multiverse to multiple tosses of scrabble letters, affirming that the outcome of the one toss that we observe isn’t affected by the outcomes of other tosses. Indeed, if we assume that a random universe is chosen among multiple alternatives at a time, we can’t explain the constants in our universe because we are <i>unable to deduce</i> that this particular outcome will happen in this attempt, no matter how many total attempts are allowed. However, White’s interpretation isn’t consistent with the more widely accepted multiverse theory, which suggests that many, if not all, possible universes coexist. Following this assumption, the multiverse theory explains the fine-tuning of the constants. Suppose I have a black box that contains an arbitrary number of balls, each with a different color, so that every possible color is included. Suppose also that I take out all the balls simultaneously. It’s not surprising that I get a neon pink ball. Given that balls of all possible colors are present in the box and that I take out all balls at the same time, we know for sure that one of them will be neon pink. We are <i>able to deduce</i> the result exclusively based on the conditions. Likewise, we can deduce the occurrence of our universe exclusively based on the coexistence of multiverses.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll consider another objection to P3 that White proposes himself and then rebuts in his paper. This objection notes that when we say, “God moves in a mysterious way,” we are not explaining any phenomenon because we have no idea how God performs the wonders. White debunks this objection by stating that theism allows us to understand <i>why</i> the universe permits life without knowing <i>how</i> it’s done. To show the loopholes in this statement, we may construct a similar argument by saying that science allows us to understand <i>why</i> the universe permits life although we are still uncertain about the mechanism. Without gaining some insights into <i>how</i> God sets the conditions in our universe, one shouldn’t assert that theism best explains the formation of the constants. Since the relationship between theism and the constants remains unknown, the likelihood that they are associated at all is just as slim as the likelihood that any other explanation and the constants are associated. Theism fails to qualify as the best explanation for the fact described in P2, so P3 is obviously false.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the FTA can be refuted both because life-permitting constants don’t stand in need of explanation and because theism doesn’t provide the best explanation for why our universe allows life. However, I want to remark that the FTA doesn’t seek to conclude there <i>is</i> a God, but only attempts to find evidential support for theism. Thus the FTA isn’t directly related to the existence of God. Since we haven’t proved that God doesn’t exist, we have to retain the potential connection between the fine-tuning of the constants and theism. Evidently, this uncertain correlation isn’t enough to make the reasonable agnostic come to the belief in God. Do we have a fine tuner? This overarching question remains unclear.</p>

    <h1>Projectibility of Properties</h1>
    <p>Since infancy, we’ve formed numerous beliefs based on induction. Personally, after several attempts to catch bees between my fingers and getting stung in return, I’ve learned from experience that I shouldn’t try to hold bees in my hand anymore. Because of inductive reasoning, we are able to go about our lives in a more reasonable way than otherwise. Although inductive reasoning seems intuitive, a formal distinction between what can and cannot be induced is hard to draw. Goodman suggests that this difficulty is not a trivial matter because it leads to the grave problem of projection. I’ll first summarize Goodman’s definition of inductive reasoning, then reconstruct of his riddle of induction, and finally present my way of tackling this problem.
</p>
    <p>Consider the argument along with an example:<br>
P1  All as-yet observed As are B.  (All as-yet observed MIT students are nerdy.)<br>
P2  We have no further evidence regarding whether As and B. (We have no further evidence regarding whether MIT students are nerdy.)<br>
C   All As are B. Or, the next observed A will be B. (All MIT students are nerdy.)
</p>
<p>No matter if C is true, Goodman claims that this argument counts as valid inductive reasoning as long as the inference conforms to the general rules of induction. When clarifying how to justify the general rules of induction, Goodman emphasizes the interdependence between these rules and the inferences; in other words, a rule needs to be adjusted if it results in an inference that we don’t accept while an inference needs to be adjusted if it violates a rule that we refuse to amend (Nelson Goodman, “The New Riddle of Induction” ).</p>
<p>Goodman has boiled the problem of induction down to the problem of differentiating between valid and invalid predictions. However, since the validity of prediction C (all MIT students are nerdy) depends on whether property B (nerdiness) is projectable, a complication arises when he tries to answer the question: what makes a property projectable?</p>
<p>Even without giving this question much thought, we clearly see that not all properties are projectable. For example, if I’ve seen someone rolling a non-defective dice three times and it has landed on six in all these instances, I shouldn’t conclude that it’s more likely for the dice to land on six than any other numbers in the next roll. However, suppose I watched the pumpkin drop from the Green Building on Halloween and observed that all pumpkins fell down instead of floating up. I’m comfortable to bet that during next year’s pumpkin drop, all pumpkins will fall down instead of floating up as well.</p>
<p>In Goodman’s opinion, the lack of projectability of a regular dice’s landing on six and the projectability of a dropped pumpkin’s falling down explains why induction is invalid in the first example, but valid in the second one. To illustrate the problem of projection, Goodman constructs the gruesome emerald example. Grue is defined as something that is green and first examined before time T or blue and not first examined before T, whereas bleen is defined as something that is blue and first examined before T or green and not first examined before T. If we don’t distinguish between projectable and non-projectable properties, then the observation that all emeralds we’ve seen before T were both green and grue confirms the hypothesis that the next emerald we see after T will still be green and the hypothesis that it will be grue, which are two inconsistent hypotheses.</p>
<p>Goodman has considered three different ways to deal with the gruesome properties, one of which suggests that projectable properties are qualitative and the non-projectable ones are positional. According to this view, because grue and bleen are defined in terms of green and blue and an arbitrary time T, they are non-projectable properties. However, we can easily reverse the argument: green can be defined as something that’s grue and first examined before T or bleen and not first examined before T; blue can be defined as something that’s bleen and first examined before T or grue and not first examined before T. Identifying a lack of symmetry between colors (green and blue) and schmolers (grue and bleen) by deciding which of the two is purely qualitative is futile because one can always reverse the argument in the aforementioned manner.</p>
<p>To give a satisfactory answer to Goodman’s problem, I recommend that we return to what he means by “inductive reasoning.” He indicates that the process of justifying inductive inferences and the rules of induction involves frequently making mutual adjustments between the two. Applying this idea to the gruesome emerald example, we can see why we should use colors rather than schmolers in making predictions. Since time T can be set arbitrarily, we can imagine constantly redefining grue by varying time T from a distant past to the present. In all these cases, the projection of grueness fails for emeralds, but the projection of greenness doesn’t. Because the “rule” that schmolers are projectable continuously yields false inferences, we should become more inclined to amend this rule and less inclined to accept predictions made from it.</p>
<p>Dissenters may note that I’m implicitly assuming because projections based on colors have been confirmed in more instances than those based on schmolers, we should take colors to be a projectable property; yet, more confirmations of a projection doesn’t always indicate that the property in question is projectable. For instance, we may agree that having pink hair isn’t a projectable property of college girls. Having encountered five college girls with pink hair, I shouldn’t conclude that all college girls have pink hair. Knowing five more college girls with pink hair doesn't make a difference to the projectability of the pink-hair property. On the other hand, that the sun will rise from the east remains a projectable property had I observed only three sunrises instead of ten. Indeed, having more confirmations isn’t a sufficient condition to justify a property as projectable, but a projectable and true property will necessarily result in predictions that are confirmed over and over again. Complying with Goodman’s way of justifying inductive reasoning, we have to question the projectability or the truth of a property that continuously yields false inferences.</p>
<p>Let’s assess the dice and the pumpkin examples with this criterion. Suppose we suspend our belief about which properties are projectable. After observing the dice landing on six three consecutive times, we can think of landing on six as either a projectable or a non-projectable property. As we roll the dice more times, there will be more occasions in which the dice doesn’t land on six. If we’ve assumed landing on six to be a non-projectable property, we would’ve inferred that the dice may or may not land on six again, and the results confirmed the inferences in all cases. If we’ve assumed landing on six to be a projectable property, we would’ve inferred that the dice will always land on six, which is false in increasing amount of instances. According to Goodman’s assertion about the interdependence between the rules of induction and the inferences, we have to reject landing on six as a projectable property because it has lead us to unacceptable inferences.</p>
<p>When we apply the same thinking process to the pumpkin example, we find the results of pumpkin drops continue to confirm our inference that the pumpkins will fall down, so the results justify the assumed rule that the downward motion of a dropped pumpkin is a projectable property. We haven’t proved that this property <i>is</i> projectable, but it has a possibility to be whereas landing on six doesn’t.</p>
<p>I’ve argued that the continuous confirmation of projections from the same property is necessary for the property to be projectable. If we assume a property to be projectable yet the assumption leads to several false inferences, we should amend the assumption in order to maintain the consistency between the rules of induction and the inferences.</p>
<p>Perhaps certain grueists will raise yet another objection. Let’s meet Shenanigian, a grueist who believes that 2020 is the magical time. Declaring that grue is something that’s green and first examined before 2020 and blue and not first examined before 2020, he concludes that because all as-yet observed emeralds are grue, the next one we will observe after 2020 will remain grue; thus, it will be blue. He admits that the past grueists, namely those who set T to be before the present time, have failed. Actually, he thinks they are crazy! He contends that only “grueness 2020” is a projectable property and other types of grueness are not.</p>
<p>I can’t use a time machine to show that Shenanigian is wrong, but I can demonstrate that his prediction is invalid. By projecting “grueness 2020,” he assumes the uniformity of nature that if all as-yet observed emeralds are grue then all emeralds are grue. However, by denying the validity of “grueness 1” though “grueness 2015,” he implies an irregularity of nature: although all as-yet observed types of grueness are non-projectable, an unobserved type of grueness is nevertheless projectable. Shenanigian is inconsistent about whether he believes the nature is uniform. His argument cannot be valid because he has furtively contradicted inductive reasoning to make an inductive inference. The same problem applies to all future grueists. Alas, all grueists, past and future, should be advised to stop projecting gruesome properties.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a property may be projectable if the resulting predictions are continuously confirmed. Though I haven’t proved that this condition is sufficient for projectability, we can see that Goodman’s riddle of induction isn’t so bleak after all. Obstinate grueists will probably come up with further criticisms to my response; meanwhile, let the gruesome properties rest in peace and I’ll keep staying away from bees.</p>

    <h1>Freedom of Choices and Moral Responsibility</h1>
    <p>“I had no choice” was my go-to excuse as a child. I remember a time in kindergarten when I gladly abided by Newton’s Second Law to bump into some kid that I didn’t like and splashed paint on her dress. Indeed, there was no way that I could change the law of physics to stop myself and the paint from accelerating when somebody else in the crowd pushed me by accident. Yet, Harry Frankfurt would still call me out on my nasty childhood behavior. Based on his belief that a person can be morally responsible for doing something even though she couldn’t have done otherwise, Frankfurt objects to the “principle of alternate possibilities” (PAP) and suggests that moral responsibility can exist in a deterministic world. As a more mature adult, I admit that the kindergarten-version-of-me was mean. However, my confession doesn’t entail that PAP is wrong; nor does it follow that moral responsibility and Determinism are compatible. I’ll first explain PAP and reconstruct Frankfurt’s counterexample. Then, I’ll clarify the definition of Determinism to show the problems in his argument. Finally, I’ll discuss why Frankfurt’s cases fail to prove the compatibility of moral responsibility and Determinism and why it only makes sense to talk about moral responsibility in a non-deterministic world.
</p>
    <p>PAP states that a person is morally responsible for what she has done only if she could have done something else. According to this principle, if someone is forced by an outside influence to perform a certain act, she shouldn’t be held responsible for it. In considering whether coercion and moral responsibility are mutually exclusive, Frankfurt constructs three different scenarios, which I’ll recount with a story. Suppose Lucas threatens Lila with death unless she robs a bank and Lila robs a bank. In the first case, Lila is utterly unreasonable: she is indifferent to the threat. She doesn’t care about life and death; she robs the bank because she strongly believes that doing so is a form of defying materialism. Frankfurt asserts that because this case doesn’t involve coercive effect, it has no relevance to our discussion. 
</p>
<p>In the second scenario, Lila is so scared that she completely forgets her former beliefs against materialism and robs a bank solely due to the threat. Frankfurt thinks she isn’t morally responsible under such condition because her earlier decision plays no role in her action.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a third possibility in which Lila is impressed by the threat, but still remembers her mission to defy materialism. The coincidence between the threat and her original intention reinforces her decision to rob a bank, though the threat alone gives her a sufficient motive for doing so. Frankfurt considers this scenario as a counterexample to the PAP. To simplify the situation, he suggests that Lucas doesn’t even need to interfere. We may imagine Lucas to be a super psychologist who is capable of monitoring Lila’s brain processes and correcting her whenever she deviates from the path to rob a bank. Alternatively, Lucas can be eliminated from the scenario if natural forces play his role. Either way, no intervention actually occurs because Lila robs a bank for reasons of her own. With this counterexample, Frankfurt concludes that (1) it’s possible for a person to be morally responsible for what she has done though she couldn’t have done otherwise. Moreover, he suggests that (2) moral responsibility can coexist with Determinism.</p>
<p>In summary, let’s consider the argument:<br>
P1  A person is morally responsible for what she has done only if she could have done otherwise (PAP).<br>
P2  If Determinism is true, she couldn’t have done otherwise for anything she has done.<br>
C   Determinism and moral responsibility are incompatible.
</p>
<p>Frankfurt’s cases aim to overthrow P1 in order to demonstrate (1). He replaces the PAP with the modified principle that a person is morally responsible for what she has done unless she did it <i>only because</i> she could not have done otherwise. He claims that this revised principle “does not appear to conflict with” (Harry Frankfurt, “Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility”) (2). Despite his inclination towards the view that Determinism and moral responsibility are compatible, he never formally defines Determinism or explains the connection between (1) and (2) in the excerpt. Due to this ambiguity, (2) remains unconvincing because it’s possible that (1) be true only in a non-deterministic world, so (2) be false.</p>
<p>To assess if Frankfurt’s cases can prove (1) and/or (2), I’ll begin by defining “Determinism” as the notion that the conjunction of the physical laws (L) and the initial state P<sub>0</sub> at time t<sub>0</sub> entails every other following state P<sub>t</sub> at every subsequent time t. In Frankfurt’s three scenarios, he proposes that Lila could be indifferent, stampeded, or impressed by the threat, implying that though she couldn’t have done otherwise, she could be affected by the outside influence in different ways. Our evaluation about Lila’s moral responsibility will heavily depend on whether her world is deterministic or not. To prove (2) and overthrow P1 with scenario 3, Frankfurt has to implicitly assume that it’s not deterministic. Otherwise, the conjunction of L and P<sub>0</sub> would leave Lila no choice but to have her intention reinforced by the threat, so L and P<sub>0</sub> would entail both the reinforcement and her action. To use Frankfurt’s own words, Lila robs a bank <i>only because</i> she could not have done otherwise; thus, we wouldn’t be entitled to blame her for either the action or the reinforcement.</p>
<p>I’ve shown that Frankfurt’s cases cannot prove (1) without making assumptions about Determinism. To see what assumptions are allowed, let’s take a look at (2) first, before completing our discussion about (1). </p>
<p>Note that by definition of Determinism, P<sub>t</sub> is a necessary logical consequence of L and P<sub>0</sub>. Frankfurt’s counterexample fails to address this causal relation. Neither Lucas’ threat nor his will manipulation or some unnamed natural forces are sufficient causes for Lila’s action. In fact, the conjunction of L and P<sub>0</sub> is the sufficient cause for her doing. Accordingly, We may recast the earlier argument as:<br>
P1’ A person is morally responsible for what she has done only if forces outside her control are sufficient causes for her action.<br>
P2’ If Determinism is true, forces outside her control (L and P<sub>0</sub>) are sufficient causes for her action.<br>
C   If Determinism is true, this person isn’t morally responsible for what she has done. (Determinism and moral responsibility are incompatible.)
</p>
<p>Clearly, Frankfurt’s argument isn’t successful in proving (2). Yet, this doesn’t mean that (2) is false, so I’ll proceed to assess (1) again under both deterministic and non-deterministic conditions. In a deterministic world, Lila wouldn’t be morally responsible for robbing the bank because every step along the way to her action is a necessary logical consequence of L and P<sub>0</sub>. Actually, Lucas or other outside forces wouldn’t be responsible either because their influences are all necessary logical consequences of L and P<sub>0</sub>. Although I’m in no position to provide the sufficient and necessary conditions for someone to be “morally responsible,” I deem it uncontroversial to say that responsibility has to involve some form of control. If Determinism is true, only L and P0 control future states, whether they be thoughts or actions, so nothing other than L and P0 can be responsible for anything. </p>
<p>We see that it only makes sense to talk about moral responsibility in a non-deterministic world. We may imagine two ways to set up the sufficient cause (S) for Lila to rob the bank, one in which acts of will are not included and one in which they are. The first possibility doesn’t involve Lila (or more strictly, her will) as part of the cause for P<sub>t</sub>, so Lila isn’t morally responsible for P<sub>t</sub>. In the second possibility, Lila has some freedom to alter P<sub>t</sub>, so she is at least partially responsible for P<sub>t</sub>. Because agents or forces other than L and P<sub>0</sub> are able to be part of S and thus have some control over future states in this world, moral responsibility can exist. Nonetheless, PAP is true and continues to serve as the criteria for judging moral responsibility. We may paraphrase “Lila has some freedom to alter P<sub>t</sub>” to “Lila could have done otherwise,” thus upholding the truth of PAP.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Frankfurt is wrong, or unclear at best, in claiming that a person can be morally responsible for doing something though she couldn’t have done otherwise, without the qualification that this statement only stands in a <i>non-deterministic</i> world. His argument cannot establish the compatibility of Determinism and moral responsibility. I’ve further reasoned that these two notions are actually incompatible. Fortunately, I consider our world to be non-deterministic and agree that the kindergarten-version-of-me deserves penalty. I couldn’t change the laws of physics, but I could haven chosen to adopt a kinder attitude as a five-year-old. This freedom of choices, I believe, is the key to moral responsibility.</p>
