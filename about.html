<h2>Me </h2>
<p>Currently a full-time MechE and EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) student at MIT, I'm also a part-time writer, <a href = "http://www.leap-usa.net/" target = "_blank">entreprenuer</a>, <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/siyulu-zoe" target = "_blank">pianist</a>, runner, p&acirc;tissier, and comedian. I like to make stuff, whether it be poetry, cake, <a href = "https://github.com/siyulu-zoe" target = "_blank">code</a>, molecules, <a href = "http://zoe-lu.wixsite.com/portfolio/archive" target = "_blank">bots</a>, music, or art.</p>
<p>In one word, I'm quirky, as demonstrated by <br>
* <a href = "poetry.html#about1" target = "_blank">this poem</a> which may or may not accurately describes my state of being as a summer intern at a pharmaceutical/cosmetic company in France<br>
* the fact that I want a snake as a pet <br>
* the fact that I'm a hippie vegan wearing only second-hand clothes while living in a <a href="https://pikans.org/" target = "_blank">clothing-optional co-op</a> <br>
* and some interesting pictures of me on Facebook...</p>
<p>HOWEVER, no person can be summed up in one word. So I encourage you to actually get to know me by reading what I write and following me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/siyulumit" target = "_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/shir19961125" target = "_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href = "https://github.com/siyulu-zoe" target = "_blank">Github!</a></p>
<p>(Extra brownie points for those who came to this site through the link on my other website! Also extra brownie points for those who is going to check out <a href="http://zoe-lu.wixsite.com/portfolio" target = "_blank">my other website</a> from here!)</p>

<h2>The Blog </h2>

<h2>You </h2>
<p>I've done a lot of talking. Time for you to jump in!</p>
<p>Who are you? <br>
* An angsty high schooler trying to get in some college?&mdash;I was a board memeber for <a href = "http://www.leap-usa.net/" target = "_blank">an educational consulting startup</a> and I tutor for pocket money ;) <br>
* A twenty-year-old struggling with existentialism and finals at the same time?&mdash;Read <a href = "poetry.html#about2" target = "_blank">this</a>; it's better than both sex and drugs. <br>
* A potential collaborator to make cool schmit?&mdash;Find out my projects <a href="http://zoe-lu.wixsite.com/portfolio/projects" target = "_blank">here</a>. <br>
* A potential employer?&mdash;Woohoo! This is my more official <a href="http://zoe-lu.wixsite.com/portfolio/resume" target = "_blank">resume</a>. </p>
<p>No matter who you are, poke me and tell me about your stories. Who knows, they may even inspire some published works (as in <a href="http://themarblecollection.org/magazine/archive/winter-2013-issue/poetry/knitting/" target = "_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://yareview.net/2013/06/father-can-you-hear-me/" target = "_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://themarblecollection.org/magazine/archive/spring-2014-issue/poetry/the-boy/" target = "_blank">here</a> and more)!</p>
